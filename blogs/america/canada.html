                    No journey through Canada would be complete without a pilgrimage to Banff National Park in Alberta.

The Banff Gondola ride provided panoramic views of the Canadian Rockies, while my encounters with native wildlife deepened my connection to the park's wilderness.

                    Heading west to Vancouver, I found myself immersed in coastal elegance.

                    My travels led me to Quebec City, where I stepped back in time within the confines of Old Quebec. Cobblestone streets, centuries-old architecture, and the iconic Ch√¢teau Frontenac transported me to a European era. Dining in charming bistros and strolling along the historic city walls allowed me to savor the unique blend of history and culture that defines Quebec City.

                    Visiting Niagara Falls, I stood in awe of this awe-inspiring natural wonder.
